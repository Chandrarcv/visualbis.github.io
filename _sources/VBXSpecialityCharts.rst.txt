    VBX Speciality Charts

The VBX Speciality Charts (see Figure above) include:

-  Gantt Chart

   A Gantt Chart shows activities (tasks or events) displayed along a
   given timeline. On the left side of the chart is the Data Grid, which
   displays the activities or resources based on dimension members. On
   the right hand side the Gantt chart displays a visual representation
   of certain activities in the typical bar display.

-  | Data Utility
   | Data Utility Component provides the Data Utility features in the
     run time. Here the user can reconfigure and create virtual copies
     of the assigned data source and select the dimensions and measures
     that should be used for the application, instead of using the
     complete data set.

Gantt Chart
***********

A Gantt Chart shows activities (tasks or events) displayed along a given
timeline. On the left side of the chart is the Data Grid, which displays
the activities or resources based on dimension members. On the right
hand side, the Gantt chart displays a visual representation of certain
activities in the typical bar display.

Data Source Requirements for a Gantt Chart
------------------------------------------

A Gantt Chart has a list of dimension / measures that can be configured
as part of the data source assignment, depending on which information is
available. Some of those dimensions are mandatory for the Gantt chart to
work, some of them are optional. You also have the option to leverage
these values in form of measure values.

+--------------------------+---------------------+
| Field Name               | Required / Optional |
+==========================+=====================+
| Actual Start Date        | Required            |
+--------------------------+---------------------+
| Actual End Date          | Required            |
+--------------------------+---------------------+
| Planned Start Date       | Optional            |
+--------------------------+---------------------+
| Planned End Date         | Optional            |
+--------------------------+---------------------+
| Progress Value           | Required            |
+--------------------------+---------------------+
| Primary Connector        | Optional            |
+--------------------------+---------------------+
| Primary Connector Type   | Optional            |
+--------------------------+---------------------+
| Secondary Connector      | Optional            |
+--------------------------+---------------------+
| Secondary Connector Type | Optional            |
+--------------------------+---------------------+

*Gantt Chart Data Requirements*

In case some of these informations – for example the Actual Start Date
and Actual End Date – are stored in form of measures in the assigned
data source, you can use the property Date Values as Measure(s) to all
the selection of measures as part of the data assignment.

As you can see in the above Table, the Gantt chart is also offering the
option to define connector options between the individual tasks. In
regards to the Connector Type, the following Table outlines the
available options.

.. _CTD:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Connector Type Value              | Description                       |
+===================================+===================================+
| StartStart                        | The second task can’t start until |
|                                   | the first task starts.            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| StartFinish                       | The second task can’t finish      |
|                                   | until the first begins.           |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| FinishStart                       | The second task can’t start until |
|                                   | the first is done.                |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| FinishFinish                      | The second task can’t finish      |
|                                   | until the first task is done.     |

*Connector Type Details*

In regards to the fields Primary Connector and Secondary Connector, you
can pass the key / ID values of the tasks as part of your data source.
The below Table shows a set of sample data rows with Actual and Planned Date
values, as well as Primary Connectory and Primary Connectory Type
information.

*Sample Data Set with Connector*

As you can see in the sample data, you can also pass more than one value
for the Primary Connector and Primary Connector Type, which then would
expect an array of values as shown in the sample data for ID 28.

How to use a Gantt Chart
------------------------

In the following steps we will outline, how you can setup a new Gantt
Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
Designer project. For these steps we assume we have a data source,
similar to the Table shown below.

*Sample Data*

You can follow the steps below to configure the Gantt Chart:

1.  Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
    Designer.

2.  Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume
    that our data source contains one measure – Progress - and six
    dimensions Dimension 1, Dimension 2, Actual Start Date, Actual End
    Date, Primary Connector and Primary Connector Type.

3.  Dimension 1 and Dimension 2 contain the information for the Task
    names.

4.  Add a Gantt Chart from the VBX Specialty Charts to your SAP
    BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

5.  Assign the data source to the Gantt Chart.

6.  Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Gantt Chart (see Figure
    below).

7.  In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
    View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
    Additional Properties.

8.  Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart in
    the Additional Properties of the Gantt Chart.

9.  For our example, in the area General Settings set the property
    Select Chart Type to the option Gantt.

10. Now navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data
    Series (see Figure below). In the area Chart Settings you can now
    activate, which dimension should be displayed as part of the Data
    Grid on the left hand side by selecting those dimension as part of
    the Data Grid Dimensions. For our example set the property Data Grid
    Members to the dimensions Dimension 1 and Dimension 2 (see Figure
    below).

11. Activate the option ID in the Data Grid Additional Columns to
    display a generated ID number for each task.

12. Activate the option Dimensions in the Data Grid Additional Columns
    to display the selected dimensions from the Data Grid.

13. Activate the property Dates in Measures when the date values are
    configured as measures in the underlying data source.

14. For our example the property Dates in Measures is disabled.

15. The Date Format property needs to be selected based on the Date
    Format provided by the assigned data source. For our example, we set
    the property Date Format to the value MM/dd/yyyy.

In the next steps you can configure the dimension assignments for each
of the elements of the Gantt Chart.

1. Set the property Actual Start Date to the dimension Actual Start
   Date.

2. Set the property Actual End Date to the dimension Actual End Date.

3. Set the property Progress to the measure Progress.

4. Now assign dimension Connector To (1) to the Primary Connector
   property.

5. Assign the dimension Connector Type (1) to the property Primary
   Connector Type.

6. Based on the configured properties, you will be able to view the
   Gantt Chart (see Figure below). With respect to the selection of
   connector and connector type, you can observe that in our example,
   the Task Systems Architecture will start simultaneously when the
   tasks Application Architecture and High Level Design get started and
   it shows the Start to Start connector lines.

Gantt Chart as Resource Chart
-----------------------------

A Resource Chart shows the timeline of the individual resource. A
resource could be an actual person with an assigned task, or a resource
could be an actual resource, such as a car or a machine, required for
the task.

Data Source Requirements for Gantt Chart as Resource Chart
----------------------------------------------------------

In general a Resource chart will require 2 dimensions, where 1 dimension
represents the Resource and one dimension represents the task. In
addition, the Resource chart requires information such as the Actual
Start Date and the Actual End date.

+------------------------+---------------------+
| Field Name             | Required / Optional |
+========================+=====================+
| Dimension for Resource | Required            |
+------------------------+---------------------+
| Dimension for Task     | Required            |
+------------------------+---------------------+
| Actual Start Date      | Required            |
+------------------------+---------------------+
| Actual End Date        | Required            |
+------------------------+---------------------+

*Gantt Chart Data Requirements*

In case some of these informations – for example the Actual Start Date
and Actual End Date – are stored in form of measures in the assigned
data source, you can use the property Date Values as Measure(s) to all
the selection of measures as part of the data assignment.

How to use Gantt Chart as a Resource Chart
------------------------------------------

In the following steps we will outline, how you can setup a new Gantt
Chart as Resource Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design
Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

1.  Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
    Designer.

2.  Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume
    that our data source shows two measures – Start Date and End Date -
    and two dimensions Sub Task and Resource.

3.  Add a Gantt Chart from VBX Specialty Charts to your SAP
    BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

4.  Assign the data source to the Gantt Chart.

5.  Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Gantt Chart (see Figure
    below).

6.  In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
    View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
    Additional Properties.

7.  Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart in
    the Additional Properties of the Gantt Chart.

8.  For our example, in the area General Settings set the property
    Select Chart Type to the option Resource.

9.  Now navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data
    Series (see Figure below). In the area Chart Settings you can now
    activate, which dimension should be displayed as part of the Data
    Grid on the left hand side by selecting those dimension as part of
    the Data Grid Dimensions. For our example set the property Data Grid
    Members to the dimensions Dimension 1 and Dimension 2, which
    represent the Resource and Task information.

10. Activate the property Dates in Measures when the date values are
    configured as measures in the underlying data source.

11. For our example the property Dates in Measures is disabled.

12. The Date Format property needs to be selected based on the Date
    Format provided by the assigned data source. For our example, we set
    the property Date Format to the value MM/dd/yyyy.

13. Set the property Actual Start Date to the value Actual Start Date.

14. Set the property Actual End Date to the value Actual End Date.

15. The property Resource Color Type can be configured with the
    following options:

    -  Color by Dimension – In our example, the dimension is Sub Task.

    -  Color by Dimension members - In our example, the dimension member will be retrieve based on dimension Resource.

16. For our example, set the property Resource Color Type to the option
    Color by Dimension which is Sub Task.

17. Set the property Series Color to the desired color for each
    dimension Sub Task (see Figure below)

Gantt Resource Chart 
--------------------

A Gantt Resource Chart shows the Resource’s Tasks displayed along a
given timeline. On the left side of the chart is the Data Grid, which
displays the activities and resources based on dimension members. On the
right hand side, the Gantt Resource Chart displays a visual
representation of the the Timeline bar showing the Resource which get
split based on their Task Start and End Time.

Data Source Requirements for a Gantt Resource Chart
---------------------------------------------------

A Gantt Resource Chart has a list of dimension / measures that can be
configured as part of the data source assignment, depending on which
information is available. Some of those dimensions are mandatory for the
Gantt chart to work, some of them are optional. You also have the option
to leverage these values in form of measure values.

+-------------------+---------------------+
| Field Name        | Required / Optional |
+===================+=====================+
| Actual Start Date | Required            |
+-------------------+---------------------+
| Actual End Date   | Required            |
+-------------------+---------------------+
| Progress Value    | Required            |
+-------------------+---------------------+

*Gantt Resource Chart Data Requirements*

In case some of these informations – for example the Actual Start Date
and Actual End Date – are stored in form of measures in the assigned
data source, you can use the property Date Values as Measure(s) to all
the selection of measures as part of the data assignment.

How to use a Gantt Resource Chart
---------------------------------

In the following steps we will outline, how you can setup a new Gantt
Resource Chart as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design
Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project

1.  Create a new project in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira
    Designer.

2.  Add a data source to the project. For our example we will assume
    that our data source contains one measure – Progress - and five
    dimensions Dimension 1, Dimension 2, Dimension 3, Actual Start Date
    and Actual End Date.

3.  Dimension 1 and Dimension 2 contains the information for the Task
    names and Dimension 3 contains the information for the Resource.

4.  Add a Gantt Chart from the VBX Specialty Charts to your SAP
    BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

5.  Assign the data source to the Gantt Chart.

6.  Navigate to the Additional Properties of the Gantt Chart.

7.  In case the Additional Properties are not shown, please use the menu
    View **•** Additional Properties to activate the display of the
    Additional Properties.

8.  Navigate to the category Appearance and to the sub category Chart in
    the Additional Properties of the Gantt Chart.

9.  For our example, in the area General Settings set the property
    Select Chart Type to the option Gantt Resource.

10. Now navigate to the category Data and to the sub category Data
    Series (see Figure below). In the area Chart Settings you can now
    activate, which dimension should be displayed as part of the Data
    Grid on the left hand side by selecting those dimension as part of
    the Data Grid Dimensions. For our example set the property Data Grid
    Members to the dimensions Dimension 1 and Dimension 2 that
    represents the Task and Sub Task Names and set the Dimension 3 that
    represents the Resource which is mandatory (see Figure below).

11. Activate the option ID in the Data Grid Additional Columns to
    display a generated ID number for each task.

12. Activate the option Dimensions in the Data Grid Additional Columns
    to display the selected dimensions from the Data Grid.

13. Activate the property Enable Date Values from Measures when the date
    values are configured as measures in the underlying data source.

14. For our example the property Enable Date Values from Measures is
    disabled.

15. Activate the property Display Individual Task.

16. The Date Format property needs to be selected based on the Date
    Format provided by the assigned data source. For our example, we set
    the property Date Format to the value MM/dd/yyyy.

In the next steps you can configure the dimension assignments for each
of the elements of the Gantt Chart.

1. Set the property Actual Start Date to the dimension Actual Start
   Date.

2. Set the property Actual End Date to the dimension Actual End Date.

3. Set the property Progress to the measure Progress.

4. Based on the configured properties, you will be able to view the
   Gantt Resource Chart (see Figure below). In our example, since the
   option Display Individual Task in the Additional Properties is
   activated, you can visualize the Gantt Resource Chart with two
   individual resources Bonnie and Mike working in the same timeline for
   a specific task Systems architecture. You can observe that Mike is
   working in two different time slots within the same timeline.

Data Utility Component
**********************

As part of the Release 2.3, you are provided with the new Data Utility
Component which provides the Data Utility features in the run time. Here
the user can reconfigure and create virtual copies of the assigned data
source and select the dimensions and measures that should be used for
the application, instead of using the complete data set. The Data
Utility Component also comes with three different component modes as
listed below:

1. Simple Mode

2. Mobile Mode

3. Mobile Advanced Mode

There is another option Enable No UI Mode where the Dashboard user can
configure the Data Utility component settings without using the above
three component modes. When the option Enable No UI Mode is activated
then you will be unable to configure the settings for the Data Utility
component using the above listed three component modes.

The VBX Data Utility Component can be also applied for the native
components of SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer.


Data Source Requirements
------------------------

The data source requirements for the Data Utility component involves one
Source Dataset and multiple Target Data sources. The Source Dataset
should be assigned to the Data Utility component and the multiple Target
Data sources like the Data Utility Source (so called the Custom Data
Source) can only be assigned to any number of chart components depending
on the choice of the Dashboard Designer.

In the upcoming sections, you will be able to follow the steps on how to
configure the Data Utility component using the three different component
modes – Simple Mode, Mobile Mode and Mobile Advanced Mode.

How to configure a Data Utility Component using Simple Mode 
-----------------------------------------------------------

.. figure:: _static/images/dut6.jpg
    :align: center

    Category General

23. Based on the above configuration, you will be able to view the Line
    Chart configured through the Data Utility Component. It provides the
    Initial View appearance in the run time and the user can reconfigure
    the initial View settings by reassigning the dimensions to both the
    rows and columns and by reassigning the measures only to the column
    (see Figure below). There is a Search option in the Initial View
    settings at run time and the user can search for the respective
    Target Datasource, Dimensions and Measures.

21. Based on the above configuration, you will be able to view the
    Mobile Mode display with the Line Chart and the Column Bar Chart
    being configured through the Data Utility Component (see Figure
    below). Here you can observe that the rendering of the component
    happens in the user defined layout. It provides the Initial View
    appearance having Dimensions and Measures in the run time with
    columns and rows appearing as buttons “C” and “R” where C represents
    the Columns and R represents the Rows. You can now only reassign the
    Dimensions to the Rows or Columns by single click on “R” or “C” at a
    time. Also, you cannot reassign the Measures to the Rows or Columns
    as they remain configured based on the design time. You can only
    remove or add the Measures and at least there should be one measure
    being added. There is an option that you can deselect the members of
    the both the Dimensions and Measures at any time.

DataSource Config as a VBX Component
************************************

The user can use the DataSource Config as a separate VBX component to
utilize the data from the custom data sources in run time.

How to use DataSource Config Component using Custom Data Source
---------------------------------------------------------------

In the following steps we will outline, how you can setup a DataSource
Config using Custom Data Source as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects
Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

1.  In SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer select the
    menu Application • New to create a new application.

2.  Select the option SAPUI5m.

3.  Enter a name for the new application.

4.  Select the Blank template.

5.  Click Create.

6.  Navigate to the Outline.

7.  Create a Grid Layout with two rows and one column.

8.  For our example, assign OData Source as a custom Data Source.
    Similarly you can use WSDL as a Custom Data Source.

9.  Now add a Line Chart component from the VBX Charts to your SAP
    BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project. Assign it
    to upper row of the Grid.

10. Now add a DataSource Config component from the VBX Speciality to
    your SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.
    Assign it to the upper row of the Grid. Your Outline looks like as
    shown in the below Figure.

Analytics
*********

As part of the VBX Release 2.4, you are provided with the new Analytics
Component which provides the complete user access information about the
already created Dashboards using SAP Lumira application. It provides the
details about the user access on the respective pages in the Dashboard.
This is achieved through synchronization done between the external
Analytics URL environment as well as the Additional Properties of this
Analytics component.

How to configure a Analytics Component 
--------------------------------------

In the following steps we will outline, how you can setup a new
Analytics component as part of your next SAP BusinessObjects Design
Studio/SAP Lumira Designer project.

1. In SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio/SAP Lumira Designer select the
   menu Application • New to create a new application.

2. Select the option SAPUI5m.

3. Enter a name for the new application.

4. Select the Blank template.

5. Click Create.

6. Navigate to the Outline.

7. For our example, create a Layout which has three tabs where each Tab
   have different Dashboards (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/images/anal1.jpg    
    :align: center

    Layout

8.  From the above Figure, you can observe that Tab 1 has Line Chart,
    Column Bar Chart, Area Chart and Polar Chart.

9.  Tab 2 has Waterfall Chart.

10. Tab 3 has Advanced Table.

11. For our example, we will assume that our data source shows four
    measures – Order Quantity, Order Amount, Order Cost and Discount
    Amount, and one Dimension – Item Category.

12. All the components have been assigned with the Data Source as
    mentioned in the above step.

13. Now assign the Analytics component as the last part of the Layout
    unlike other Speciality Charts which is mandatory (see Figure below). 

.. figure:: _static/images/anal2.jpg    
    :align: center

    Layout with Analytics Component

14. Navigate to the category General and to the sub category General
    Settings.

15. In the area Server Configuration, enter the Analytics URL into the
    property Server URL (see Figure below). 

.. figure:: _static/images/anal3.jpg    
    :align: center
    
    Category General

16. You can create a new Dashboard in the Additional Properties of the
    Analytics component using the property Add New Dashboard (see Figure
    above).

17. You can fetch the already created Dashboards by entering the
    Username and Password.

18. You can set the View Name through the property View Name for the
    initial screen at run time which would get displayed in the
    Analytics URL. The other view names for the succeeding screens can
    be done through the script DSXSetViewName().

19. For our example, now navigate to the Standard Properties of the
    TABSTRIB (see Figure below). 

.. figure:: _static/images/anal4.jpg    
    :align: center

    On Select Event for Tabstrip

20. In the Script Editor for Tab Strip, generate the script for the On
    Select Event as shown below:

**var** curTab=TABSTRIP_1.getSelectedTabIndex();

**if** (curTab == 0) {

ANALYTICS_1.DSXSetViewName("Dashboard1");

} **else** {

**if** (curTab == 1) {

ANALYTICS_1.DSXSetViewName("Dashboard2");

}

else{

ANALYTICS_1.DSXSetViewName("Dashboard3");

}

}

21. For our example based on the above Script, the DemoDashboard will
    respond to the Set View Names Dashboard 1, Dashboard 2 and Dashboard
    3 at the back end on each click for Tab 1, Tab 2 and Tab 3. By
    default it shows the First Tab (see Figure below). 

.. figure:: _static/images/anal5.jpg    
    :align: center

    Tab 1 in Dashboard

22. The number of visits made to the View Names can be observed in the
    Analytics URL (see Figure below). Here the details are synchronized
    between Additional Properties of the Analytics component and the
    Analytics URL.

.. figure:: _static/images/anal6.jpg
