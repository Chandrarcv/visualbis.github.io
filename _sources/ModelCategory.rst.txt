3. To create a value driver tree (valQ) in Power BI, it is mandatory to
   assign a Data Source to the value driver tree. For our example, a
   data source (sample data shown below) has been assigned to the value
   driver tree.

    Sample Data

4. Now at least one Measure Value has to be assigned to the property
   “Values” in Visualizations panel. In our example, we have assigned
   the Measure Value “∑ Actual” to the property “Values” by clicking the
   check box option against the Measure Value “∑ Actual” (see Figure
   below).

The Nodes hierarchy will be displayed in the Advance Editor option as
shown in the above Figure. Here you will be able to add number of child
nodes from the parent node “Net Profit”. By clicking the Parent Node,
you will be able to add number of child nodes as shown below. Also you
will be able to expand, collapse and delete the entire Nodes Hierarchy
using the options “Expand”, “Collapse” and “Delete” (see Figure above).

As part of the New Release, the "Lock" and "Unlock" options have been included in the 
Advance Editor for the Node Tab (see Figure below). By clicking the lock option, you will not 
be able to edit the configuration done for the Node (see Figure below).

By clicking the Edit option you will be able to view the Edit Settings
for the Node. The Edit Settings are categorized as follows:

1. General

2. Configuration

3. Display

4. Simulation

5. Business Definition

6. Conditional Formatting 



General
~~~~~~~

In General settings you will be able to configure the Node details such
as Unique ID, Title and the Title Prefix when outside the Tree with the
values as shown in the below Figure. The Title Prefix can be set at Node
Level and during simulation it is useful to identify at which node the
parameter value changes. The additional properties of the Node Tab has
been listed in :ref:`Section: Additional properties of the Node Tab <ADPR>`. 

.. figure:: _static/12.8.png
    :align: center

    Edit Node – General Settings

Based on the above configuration, you will be able to view the valQ
screen as shown below.

.. figure:: _static/12.9.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

    valQ screen with General settings

From the above Figure, you can observe that the Unique ID for the Parent
Node is “TOP” and the Title of the Parent Node is “Net Profit”.

In our other example as shown below, we have configured the Title Prefix
for two different Nodes (see Figures below).

.. figure:: _static/12.10.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Node with Prefix value as Spouse 1

.. figure:: _static/12.11.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Node with Prefix value as Spouse 2

Based on the above set of configurations, you will be able to view the
valQ screens as shown below.

.. figure:: _static/12.12.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

    :alt: alternate text

    valQ screen with Spouse 2 Prefix

From the above two Figures you can observe that the “Gross Salary” is
the common Title for two different Nodes. In order to differentiate
them, we have provided the value for “Title Prefix when outside the
Tree” as Spouse1 for one Node and Spouse 2 for the other Node. After
simulation, you can see which Node’s value has been changed.

Configuration 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Configuration Settings, you will be able to configure the Node
details such as Calculation Method, Time Aggregation, Desired Trend and
Value Range with the values as shown in the below Figure.

.. figure:: _static/12.14.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Edit Node – Configuration Settings

Based on the above Configuration settings, you will be able to view the
valQ screen as shown in the below Figure.

.. figure:: _static/12.15.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

    valQ with Configuration settings

From the above Figure you can observe that in the Navigation Panel, the
value that is displayed in the Constraints section will lie in the range
from minimum 10 to maximum 100 for a specific month based on the
configuration done for the Value Range. In our example, the calculation
method is selected as “Subtract Children (a-b-c)” meaning that the child
node having greater value will get subtracted from the child node having
smaller value and its result will be displayed in the Parent Node. The
Time Aggregation is set to Sum of Periods where we have considered 12
months as period. As the result of simulation, each Node will display
the values based on the Sum of Periods. Also the “Desired Trend” has
been set to the Increase option. When simulated, the desired Trend for
the Revenue will be increasing and the value for the Total Cost will be
decreasing.

For other options of calculation method, you can refer the link: https://valq.com/blogs/assigning-values-to-nodes-in-valq/

For the Calculation Method being selected as "Data Source", you can follow the steps as explained in the following link : https://valq.com/blogs/3-methods-of-mapping-valq-nodes-to-data/

Constant Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the Constant Node option, you will be able to use the constant value for any Node. 
For our example, navigate to the Configuration settings for the Node "Revenue" (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/cnode1.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Configuration settings for Constant Node 

Now select the Node Type as "Constant". Select the option "Formula" for the 
Calculation Method and provide the value as "120000" in the Custom Formula Area. 
Based on the above settings you will be able to view the valQ screen with Node "Revenue" having the 
constant value as "120000" (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/cnode2.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Node "Revenue" with  Constant value  

Calculation method as Formula
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Different Formulas can be configured at the Node Level using the Configuration option. 
For our example, we have the Parent Node as Products and 4 different child nodes Books, Furniture, Garments 
and Sum of Products under the Parent Node. 

.. figure:: _static/form1a.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Product Node with child nodes 

Using the custom formula, you will be able to arrive the sum of these products at the separate Node level.
For achieving the same, navigate to the Edit Node option of Sum of Products Node and click the Configuration option 
as shown in the below Figure.

.. figure:: _static/form1.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Calculation Method as "Formula"

In the Calculation method, select the "Formula" option. For our example, provide the Formula input as 
"SUM(N1,N2,N3)" in the Custom Formula Field. As an end result, you will be able to view the valQ screen
with the "Sum of Products" Node showing the sum of all these 3 products (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/form2.png

*Range Functions* 

Template Nodes selection in Calculation Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Also you can create a Template Node for the already existing Node. It
is very specific that the Template Nodes should not map the Parent
Node. You need to select the particular Node and copy a Node under the
selected Node for creating the Template Node.

In the below Figure as an example, you can observe that a copy of
Revenue Node has been created by the right click copy and paste actions.
Now the copied Revenue Node version is labelled as “Revenue 2” in
General Property of the Edit Node Window (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/13.3.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Edit Node: Copy of Revenue Node labelled as Revenue 2

Now navigate to the Configuration property of the Edit Node Window. Set
the Calculation Method to the option Template based on the node. Also
set the Node to use as Template to the option 1:Revenue (see Figure
below).

.. figure:: _static/13.4.png
    :align: center

    :alt: alternate text

    Tree with composite nodes

You can observe that the Nodes “10:Production Cost” and “36: Realisation Cost” have been added as the 
composite nodes to the node “Revenue”. Also when a simulation is done in the actual 
Nodes (10:Production Cost” and “36: Realisation Cost), the similar simulation will get reflected in the 
composite nodes and it is vice versa (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/cnd4.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

Conditional Formatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the Conditional Formatting option, you will be able to apply the Alert Thresholds and Rules at the specific Node Level (see Figure below). For our example, the Node "Revenue"
has been selected.

.. figure:: _static/cfn1.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Conditional Formatting Settings for Node

In the Conditional Formatting settings for the Node "Revenue", you have 3 different options as highlighted in the above Figure. 

When the option "Global or Inherited Rule" is selected, then the Conditional Formatting Rules configured as Global Level in the Settings Tab  
will be applied here.

Now set the option as "Custom Rule: Overwrites default or any inherited rules" as shown in the below Figure.

.. figure:: _static/cfn2.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Conditional Formatting Settings for Node - Custom Rule option with Percentage selection

The Custom Rule option can be configured based on variance percentage values and the values applied at period level (see Figure above). 

For our first example, set the option for the Custom Rule as "Percentage" and also enable the property "Apply to Descendants". Set the Threshold values as shown in the above Figure.
After simulation, you can find that the Variance percentage value for the Node "Revenue" falls in the Threshold range (4%)* which is between -10% to -1% and based on that condition, the status bar for the Node Revenue is yellow color (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/cfn3.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

    Custom Rule option with Percentage value selection for the Node "Revenue"

Also you can observe that the Descendant Node "Copper Price" has been updated with the same Threshold settings based on our configuration. 
The Variance percentage value for the Descendant Node "Copper Price" falls in the Threshold range (8%)* which is Above 1% and based on that condition, the status bar for the Descendant Node "Copper Price" is green color (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/cfn4.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

    Custom Rule option with Percentage value selection for the Descendant Node "Copper Price"

For our second example, set the option for the Custom Rule as "Value (applied at Period Level) - see Figure below.

.. figure:: _static/cfn5.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Custom Rule option with value selection for the Node "Revenue"

Set the Threshold values as shown in the above Figure. After simulation, you can find that the 
Metric value for the Node "Revenue" falls in the Threshold range (522.3)* which is Above 1 
and based on that condition, the status bar for the Node Revenue is green color (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/cfn6.png
    :align: center
    :width: 1000
    :alt: alternate text

    Custom Rule option with Value selection for the Node "Revenue"

**Note:**
"*" denotes that the Metric values get calculated based on the Period Level. For example when it is a Year, it will take the value of 12 being multiplied with the range value that we provide.

Now set the option to "Hidden: No Rule will be applied to this Node". You can observe that no range values can be provided for the Conditional Formatting and since there will be no status color for that Node being simulated. 

Secondary KPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the Secondary KPI option, you will be able to configure the KPI values for the Node based on the Formula and Template options.
For our example, the tree structure looks similar to the Figure shown below:

*Additional Properties of New Tab*

Node Tab
========

Each node represents a metric, and can contain the following:

-  Name of the value driver or KPI

-  A sparkline graph indicating the recent trend

-  The value of the metric in bold letters

.. figure:: _static/13.1.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Node Details

In addition, each node also contains several performance metrics (see
Figure below). They are listed as follows:

-  The Fiscal Year variance of the metric vs. a benchmark (in this case,
   Sales Forecast vs. Sales Budget) – this is shown in both % and
   absolute terms

-  Absolute value of the metric for the current month (usually the first
   period in the series)

-  Variance of the metric vs. a benchmark for the current month – this
   is shown in both % and absolute terms.

A node may be decorated by a performance indicator color band on the
left – typically Green (for good), Amber (neither good nor bad) and Red
(Poor).

    Data Series Tab – Data Series Manager

For our example, we have the data source having periods from Jan to Dec, Budget and Forecast values. The Budget values will be the Comparison values and the Forecast values will be the Baseline values.
Follow the below steps for configuring the values in the Data Series Manager.

1. Set the property Period(s) per data series to the value 5. 
2. Configure the Period Labels as Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May (see Figure above).
3. Enable the property Include comparison data series. You can view both the Baseline and Comparison values.
4. When the property Include comparison data series is disabled, then you will be able to view only the Baseline Series.
5. Since our data set has the Additional values Additional 1 and Additional 2, it will be displayed as Additional Series (see Figure above).
6. When you click the Baseline label, you will be able view the Baseline values as Forecast values as shown below.
