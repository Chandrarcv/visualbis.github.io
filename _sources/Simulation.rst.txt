Value Display and Simulation Period

    Value Display

With the ‘Value Display’ functionality you can choose the time
aggregation you want to display as the primary value. The designer can
link certain nodes to a user selected scaling. You can select the scale
you wish to display by selecting this under the Value Display section.
Note that the options here can be configured so they may differ. It is
important to note that not all notes are scaled using this as the value
driver tree typically contains both amounts, prices, rates and physical
volumes.

In addition to the primary display value, the designer can also choose a
secondary value to be displayed. I.e. if you are showing Full Year as
primary, in the below example, it has been configured to visualize the
Month data as secondary:

    Value Display

The time aggregation and display relates to the Simulation Period
selected.

When **Month** is selected, it shows the first month of the simulation
interval selected. By default, the simulation period is the selected
period and the future. This is an important concept as when we simulate,
we generally don’t want to apply a change to the past as we can’t change
it. It is possible to also set the ‘to’ period in a simulation, just
click |..image::_static/image11| and highlight the month you want as the end period of a
simulation. This is however a special scenario.

    Simulation Period

**YTD** – the selected period -1 is the year to date data (eg. selected
simulation period is September to December, the YTD data will be from
Jan to August).

Note: Simulation of future periods will not impact the YTD data.

    Value Display and Simulation Period

**Sim. Period** – to simulate a specific period, for example a 3 month
rolling forecast from September to November, click the first month
September then click |..image::_static/image15|\ and click the last month November for
simulation. You can then choose to only show the values aggregated for
the selected simulation periods

Sub Models - Filters
--------------------

If your Value Driver Tree is large, the designer may have defined
specific sub views. These would be listed under the Sub Models Section
of the Navigation Panel. When clicking on one of these views, the tree
will be filtered and the specific node will be made the top node.
Calculation dependencies are still respected but this significantly
improves the navigation as it focuses the tree on a specific area.

In this example, the options defined are:

-  Open all company level: Net Profit

-  Open per department: Mining, Processing or the operational tree for
   Mill Throughput

KPIs
----

The Navigation Panel can be configured to list a set of KPI’s from the
value driver tree. You are able to navigate to each of them for a fast
view on the simulation impact on a given KPI. Click on the KPI to
navigate to the node.

Data Simulation
---------------

There are 2 options to simulate:

-  Hover over a desired node to simulate, slide the scaling button to
   right for positive impact or left for negative impact. The simulation
   will be showed on the right hand side. A window will open displaying
   the changes. The pencil icon will display the change in percentage
   that has been made: |..image::_static/image19|, and a legend with percentage showing
   if the adjust has made the scenario better or worse |..image::_static/image20|.

    Data Simulation

-  Click on the arrow icon of the node |..image::_static/image22| then click ‘Edit Key
   Input’ |..image::_static/image23| and manually edit the changes in simulation per
   period. Click X to close manual input table.

Notes

-  You can update the periods highlighted in YELLOW based on the
   selected simulation period.

    Simulation Periods

The edit icon will indicate the months that have been edited.

    Simulation Periods

-  You can update the ‘Variation’ column which will overwrite the
   numbers in the selected simulation periods. Any manual updates in
   period will not be overwritten by the ‘Variation’ column. In the
   example below, in blue are the months which were manually edited and
   in orange are highlighted the variation and in this case the month to
   which the variation was applied.
