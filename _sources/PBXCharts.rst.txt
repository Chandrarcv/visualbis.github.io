Visual BI Extensions for Microsoft Power BI (PBX) Charts
=============================================================================================

With the PBX suite you receive a large set of additional charts. In the following sections we will review the detailed functionality of the different chart types. 

Multiple Axes Charts
********************

The Multiple Axes Chart provides the option to setup a chart with minimum of 5 axis as you have measures in the assigned data source, meaning you could create a chart with an axis for each measure. The below Figure 
represents the Multiple Axes Chart with 1 dimension - Product with 3 Measures - Discount Amount, Order Amount and Order Quantity. There are 3 Value Axis being shown in the Figure below.

How to use the Multiple Axes Chart in Power BI? 
-----------------------------------------------

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Multiple Axes Chart in Power BI Platform.
For our example we will assume that we are going to use a data source with a dimension Product 
and measures Discount Amount, Order Amount and Order Quantity.

1. Create a new project in Power BI Platform. 
2. Click Get Data Source and select the Excel File with the data source similar to the description outlined previously. 
3. Add a Multiple Axes Chart from the Visualization Section to your Power BI project. 
4. Assign the data source to the Multiple Axes Chart. For our example, assign the 
   Dimension  - Product to the property Axis and assign the Measures -  Discount Amount, Order Amount and Order Quantity to the property Value Axis 1 in the Category Fields (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/m2.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Visualization Settings 

In the above example, you can also assign the Measures and Dimensions to the Power BI Project by clicking the 
respective check boxes against the Dimension and Measures in the Fields Section (see Figure above). 

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Value Axis                                                                                                                 |
+============================================================================================================================+
| The Measures can be assigned to any one of the 5 Value Axis and the Chart gets plotted based on the assigned Value Axis.   |                                                                       
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

5. Navigate to the property Tooltips in the Category Fields. Here the Measures and Dimensions can be dragged into this property so that you will be able to view the Measures and Dimensions as a Tooltip (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/m3.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Visualization Settings 

In the above example, the Measure Discount Amount has been used as Tooltip (see Figure above).

1. Navigate to the Area Data Measures in the category Format (see Figure below). For our example, there are three Measures - Discount Amount, Order Amount and Order Quantity and one dimension - Product. By default, all the Measures will be enabled. When any one Measure is disabled, 
   the Multiple Axes Chart will get displayed without the display of the disabled Measure. For our example, the measure Discount Amount has been disabled.

Horizon Charts
**************

Horizon charts are small multiple area charts visualization. 
They can be quite useful for visualizing changes in distributions over time or space. 
It is small-multiple area charts that allow greater precision for a given vertical space by 
using colored bands. These charts can also be used with diverging color scales to 
differentiate positive and negative values.

Horizon charts are partially overlapping line plots that create the impression of a mountain range (see Figure below).

How to use the Horizon Chart in Power BI? 
-----------------------------------------

In the following steps we will outline how you can setup a new Horizon Chart in Power BI Platform.
For our example we will assume that we are going to use a data source with two dimensions - Product and Date  
and measures Discount Amount, Order Amount and Order Quantity.

1. Create a new project in Power BI Platform. 
2. Click Get Data Source and select the Excel File with the data source similar to the description outlined previously. 
3. Add a Horizon Chart from the Visualization Section to your Power BI project. 
4. Assign the data source to the Horizon Chart. For our example, assign the 
   Dimension Product to the property Category and assign the Dimension Date to the property Time Period. Assign the Measure Order Quantity to the property Value (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/h2.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Visualization Settings 

In the above example, you can also assign the Measures and Dimensions to the Power BI Project by clicking the 
respective check boxes against the Dimension and Measures in the Fields Section (see Figure above). 

5. Now navigate to the Category Format in the Visualization Section. The Category Format for the Horizon Chart 
   has the following areas:

   1. License
   2. General
   3. Base Value
   4. Layers
   5. Color Scheme
   6. Legend
   7. Number Formatting
   8. Global Fonts
   
The following sections will highlight the individual configuration of the properties for the Horizon Chart.

License
~~~~~~~

The License Area will display the License details of the PBX Component (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/h3.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    License

General
~~~~~~~

1. For our example, set the property Chart Margin to the value 100 in the Area General (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/h4.png
    :align: center

    General 

2. Set the property Tick Interval to the value 1.
3. Set the property X Position to the value 8.
4. Set the property Y Position to the value 0.
5. Set the property Width to the value 1270.
6. Set the property Height to the value 719.
7. Set the property Alt Text to the description of your choice.
8. Based on the above set of configurations, you will be able to view the Horizon Chart as shown below.

    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Horizon Chart with General configuration  

From the above Figure, you can observe that the Measures based on the Product and Time Stamp will be viewed as small-multiple area charts. As you hover the mouse over those charts, you will be able to
view the distributed values of the Measures in that range.

Base value
~~~~~~~~~~

Base Value are the value from which the Positive or Negative changes are plotted on the Chart. Now navigate to the Area Base Value. Set the property Base Value to the value 100 (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/h6.png
    :align: center
