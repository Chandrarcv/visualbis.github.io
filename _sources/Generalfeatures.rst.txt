General Features of valQ Custom Visual
======================================

Instructions for valQ Custom Visual 
------------------------------------

The valQ Custom Visual provides various components that the Designer can
use in conjunction with Microsoft Power BI. The valQ custom visual also
offers many configuration options.

In this guide, we will describe the common end user functionality using
a demo as an example. It is however important to understand that your
specific implementation may differ.

Once your designer has implemented and configured the valQ Custom
Visual, it will be accessed the same way you access your current Power
BI Apps.

When you open a valQ Custom Visual, it will open in a similar manner at
the screenshot below:

.. figure:: _static/4.1.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    valQ Screen

The left panel is the navigation panel and on the canvas you will find
the value driver tree. By default, the tree is open on collapsed mode at
a level defined by the designer. This is typically completely collapsed.

Input Data
----------

The valQ Custom Visual works with two input data series – the primary
and the comparison data series. A common way of using this is to compare
Forecast vs Budget, Budget vs Last Year Actuals etc. The data series is
at a certain time grain. This would typically be 1 year by 12 months or
a multiyear view like 5 years plan by year.

The selecting of the time series will often be based on Filters or
Variables. A typical scenario is where the designer has defined 4
variables on the underlying data sources:

Primary:

Version: ie. Defaulted to Forecast

Year: ie. Defaulted to Current Year

Comparison:

Version ie. Defaulted to Budget

Year ie. Defaulted to Current Year

This allows the users to compare different versions and years in the
value driver tree model.

The valQ Custom Visual can display individual periods but can also apply
time aggregation such as Full Year, Year-to-Date. You can see the
currently selected Value Display aggregation on the Navigation Panel. In
the screenshot above, Full Year is selected. The primary value displayed
on the Widgets is therefore in this instance the Full Year aggregated
data.

Tree Drill Down
---------------

Nodes that has children will have an expand ‘>’ button to the right of
the Widget as highlighted below:

.. figure:: _static/4.2.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Nodes with children

You can drill down the tree by clicking the expand button.

The tree will focus on the branches that are being expanded. You can
collapse any specific node by clicking the ‘<’ collapse button on the
right of a widget.

Value Driver Trees are in reality networks. The same driver may impact
multiple aspects of the Tree. The component therefore contains a concept
of linked nodes. Such nodes have a link |..image::_static/image4| icon that you can click
which will jump to where the linked node is defined and highlight the
node:

.. figure:: _static/4.3.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Link

.. figure:: _static/4.4.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Linked Nodes

To collapse all nodes, click on the collapse icon on the bottom left of
the canvas |..image::_static/image7|

Zoom and Pan
------------

Value Driver Trees can be large. You can zoom and pan the canvas view.
If you are using an iPad or iPhone, you can zoom by pinching and pan by
dragging the same way you would navigate a map.

If you are using a mouse with a scroll wheel, you can point your curser
anywhere in the canvas and scroll the wheel to zoom in and out.

To pan, click and hold the left bottom of the mouse and drag the tree
around.

You can also use the zoom button to zoom if your device doesn’t support
other options |..image::_static/image8|


Expand/Collapse One Level
-------------------------

In the Runtime, you will be able to expand/collapse the Node Hierarchy at one level using the "<" and ">" buttons (see Figure below). 

.. figure:: _static/exl.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Expand/collapse one level 

For our example, the Node Hierarchy level has been driven from second level to third level.

Value Display and Simulation Period
-----------------------------------

.. figure:: _static/4.5.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Value Display

With the ‘Value Display’ functionality you can choose the time
aggregation you want to display as the primary value. The designer can
link certain nodes to a user selected scaling. You can select the scale
you wish to display by selecting this under the Value Display section.
Note that the options here can be configured so they may differ. It is
important to note that not all notes are scaled using this as the value
driver tree typically contains both amounts, prices, rates and physical
volumes.

In addition to the primary display value, the designer can also choose a
secondary value to be displayed. I.e. if you are showing Full Year as
primary, in the below example, it has been configured to visualize the
Month data as secondary:

.. figure:: _static/4.6.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Value Display

The time aggregation and display relates to the Simulation Period
selected.

When **Month** is selected, it shows the first month of the simulation
interval selected. By default, the simulation period is the selected
period and the future. This is an important concept as when we simulate,
we generally don’t want to apply a change to the past as we can’t change
it. It is possible to also set the ‘to’ period in a simulation, just
click |..image::_static/image11| and highlight the month you want as the end period of a
simulation. This is however a special scenario.

.. figure:: _static/4.7.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Simulation Period

**YTD** – the selected period -1 is the year to date data (eg. selected
simulation period is September to December, the YTD data will be from
Jan to August).

Note: Simulation of future periods will not impact the YTD data.

    Value Display and Simulation Period

**Full Year** – Shows the full year cumulated data

.. figure:: _static/4.9.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Value Display and Simulation Period

**Sim. Period** – to simulate a specific period, for example a 3 month
rolling forecast from September to November, click the first month
September then click |..image::_static/image15|\ and click the last month November for
simulation. You can then choose to only show the values aggregated for
the selected simulation periods

.. figure:: _static/4.10.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Value Display and Simulation Period

As part of the New Release, you will be able to view the Tooltip for all the Value Displays. 
For our example, the Tooltip for the Month Value Display is shown in the below Figure.

.. figure:: _static/vd1.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Tooltip for Month Value Display

Similarly you can view the Tooltip for other Value Displays.

Sub Models - Filters
--------------------

If your Value Driver Tree is large, the designer may have defined
specific sub views. These would be listed under the Sub Models Section
of the Navigation Panel. When clicking on one of these views, the tree
will be filtered and the specific node will be made the top node.
Calculation dependencies are still respected but this significantly
improves the navigation as it focuses the tree on a specific area.

In this example, the options defined are:

-  Open all company level: Net Profit

-  Open per department: Mining, Processing or the operational tree for
   Mill Throughput

.. figure:: _static/4.11.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Sub Models – Filters

KPIs
----

The Navigation Panel can be configured to list a set of KPI’s from the
value driver tree. You are able to navigate to each of them for a fast
view on the simulation impact on a given KPI. Click on the KPI to
navigate to the node.

    KPIs

Data Simulation
---------------

There are 2 options to simulate:

-  Hover over a desired node to simulate, slide the scaling button to
   right for positive impact or left for negative impact. The simulation
   will be showed on the right hand side. A window will open displaying
   the changes. The pencil icon will display the change in percentage
   that has been made: |..image::_static/image19|, and a legend with percentage showing
   if the adjust has made the scenario better or worse |..image::_static/image20|.

.. figure:: _static/4.13.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Data Simulation

-  Click on the arrow icon of the node |..image::_static/image22| then click ‘Edit Key
   Input’ |..image::_static/image23| and manually edit the changes in simulation per
   period. Click X to close manual input table.

Notes

-  You can update the periods highlighted in YELLOW based on the
   selected simulation period.

    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Simulation Periods

-  You can update the ‘Variation’ column which will overwrite the
   numbers in the selected simulation periods. Any manual updates in
   period will not be overwritten by the ‘Variation’ column. In the
   example below, in blue are the months which were manually edited and
   in orange are highlighted the variation and in this case the month to
   which the variation was applied.

    :alt: alternate text

    Simulation Periods

Click reset icon to return to the original data |..image::_static/image27|.

As part of the New Release, you can simulate the Node having "0" as the value. When the slider is moved to the right end, it will show positive values and when the 
slider is moved to the left end, it will show negative values. The property of the Simulation remains the same for the Change Percentage,
Manual, Growth Percentage and Constant options.

Understanding Variances
=======================

The starting point for a simulation is a selection of two versions -
**Primary Version** and a **Comparison Version** and a year. For
instance a forecast vs current budget.

Once we start simulating, changes are applied to the primary version. We
call this changing version the Simulation.

To understand the improvements we achieve, we also keep track of the
original values from the primary version without simulation changes. We
therefore have 3 data series in the model that we calculate and compare:

1. Simulation (The Primary Version including applied variations)

2. Original (The Primary Version without variations)

3. Target (The Comparison Version)

Based on the above, we calculate the following variances:

-  Simulated Variance (Simulation vs Target)

Q: If we changed these things, would we hit target?

-  Simulation Impact (Simulation vs Original)

Q: How much would we improve if we made these changes?

-  Original Variance (Original vs. Target)

Q: What was our variance if we did nothing?

Understanding the Node Widget Information
=========================================

The Node Widget for a Value Driver displays key information such as
value, variance, simulation impacts and trend without having to navigate
further.

.. figure:: _static/6.1.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Node Widget Information

Conducting what-if analysis
===========================

One of the main aspects of the valQ Custom Visual is to be able to
simulate the impacts changes to key drivers such as prices have on the
full year forecast. As we can’t change the past, such a simulated change
should only be applied to future period. The valQ Custom Visual have
this capability. When performing what-if analysis, the period that a
simulation should be applied from is selected in the Side Panel (current
period is default):

.. figure:: _static/7.1.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    What-if-Analysis

Assuming that we calculate fuel cost based on litre per month and price
as $/l and we are at the end of period 9, the simulated cost should be
calculated first at the monthly level with the % change applied to
period 9 and onwards. Once the individual months are calculated, they
can then be aggregated based on the rule of the node (sum for diesel
cost, weighted average for diesel price):

.. figure:: _static/formula.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

When hovering over a node, the bottom half of the node becomes a slider.
Drag the slider left to vary the node by a negatively, drag right for
positive. As you drag, the values for the selected node is dynamically
recalculated and displayed. When releasing, the tree will immediately
recalculate all dependent nodes and show the result.

.. figure:: _static/7.2.png 
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Simulation

A simulation change is either a pct. Change, a fixed future price or a
pct. Growth depending on the simulation model defined for the value
driver.

The default method for the driver can be seen on the simulation tooltip.
You can also change the selected model by selecting at the bottom of the
tooltip.

.. figure:: _static/7.3.png 
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Simulation Tooltip

Understanding that a change is applied to the selected periods only is
particularly important to understand when displaying the Full Year value
and the node is using a weighted average. The displayed value is the
weighted average value for the full year, not the value for future
periods.

A simplified example will help understanding this critical concept.
Let’s assume that the diesel price is $1.014 for all periods and the
monthly fuel consumption is constant as well at 1m litres and we have
selected period 9 as we want to apply the simulation to the remaining
periods of the year.

We now drag the slider for the fuel price to the right and the node will
show the new weighted average value. Let’s say we drag it to the right
so the full year weighted average is $1.030. As the first 8 periods were
$1.014, the weighted average of $1.030 means that the simulated price
change is equivalent of a future fuel price of $1.20. To better
understand the individual future period simulations when looking a Full
Year aggregated number, it is useful to pay attention to the Month Data
also shown on the node. The real world is a little more complex as the
price is not necessarily the same every month and the fuel consumed is
unlikely to be constant as well. Below is an example of such a
simulation based on a real data set:

.. figure:: _static/7.4.png 
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Simulation

The weighted average price was 1.014. We now simulated a 2% increase in
the prices selected and future periods which equates to a new weighted
average price of 1.030. If you look at the month Value, you can see for
the selected month, this equates to the higher price of 1.195.

Multiple variations can be applied in parallel as they are expressed as
pct. The top left % indicate the cumulative impact on this particular
node of all simulation that impacts it.

Any node with a variation will have the blue pen icon in the top middle
showing the percentage the node has been varied with. For quick what-if
analysis at any level and a dynamic work process from the general to the
specific, you can apply a simulation on any level.

Certain nodes may have been locked from changes in the model. This is
generally when there is a specific reason not to vary this node directly
for consistency purposes. A locked node will not have the grey pen icon
|..image::_static/image48|\ or a slider when hovering.

Certain nodes may be displayed multiple times in the tree. An example is
Material Moved as it affects Mining and Mill Throughput. In these
scenarios, one node is linked to the other. If you simulate a change in
a linked node, the node it is pointing to is instead changed so it
applies both to the selected node and anywhere else where the driver is
used. If a node is a linked node, it has the Linked node text in the
bottom right corner:

.. figure:: _static/7.5.png 
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Simulation

Getting more information about a Value driver
=============================================

If you click on a node Widget, a detail page is displayed with
additional information on the selected node.

.. figure:: _static/8.1.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Information on Value Driver

For some nodes, the designer may have added a description beyond the
title. If so, this will be displayed below the title.

If a node is calculated, a simplified version of the formula is
displayed. This is the technical formula that is used to calculate
individual period values. To calculate the real values, all simulation
variations that affects the node are applied to selected and future
periods and the aggregation rules for the node is applied (sum or
weighted average).

The trend chart compares the simulated value to the comparison version
as well as showing the original value as the dotted line on the bar if
simulation variations are active. If you hover over the bar, you will
the see the details for the period.

The table on the top right shows the period and full year values and the
variance calculations as per the definition previously in this document.

The valQ Custom Visual also analyses all the active simulations to see
if any impacts this particular node. If so, it then analyses how much
each of the active simulation changes contributes to the overall impact
on this node and generates a waterfall diagram with the break down which
is displayed in the bottom right panel.

In some scenarios, you may vary multiple factors impacting the same node
in a compound nature. I.e. you vary both sales volume and sales price
and want to know the impact on revenue. As the sum of both changes is
more than the impact of each individually, the waterfall chart breaks
down each of the individual impacts and a compound impact bar.

As part of the latest Release, you will be able to view the Value Display Tooltip by hovering the mouse over the Trend Chart Area
in the Detail page (see Figure below). Also you can view the data labels for the X Axis. The values representing the loss status will be in Red 
color and the values representing the gain status will be ib Green color as shown in the below Figure.

    Detail Page Display

Saving and Opening Scenarios 
=============================

The standard valQ Custom Visual template contains functionality for
saving and opening a scenario collection.

When clicking the Edit button |..image::_static/image51| , you will be asked to provide a
Scenario Title Name.

.. figure:: _static/9.1.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Scenario Title Name

You will be also able to delete the existing scenario from there using
the Delete button |..image::_static/image53|.

There is also an option to export the value driver tree data set to xml.
It will create an unformatted spreadsheet with the tree and all the node
data.

valQ in Power BI
================

The valQ Custom Visual has two different panels along with the
Visualizations and Fields input screen from Power BI. The left panel
represents the Advanced Editor and Navigation Panel. The right canvas is
provided with Enter Design Mode button |..image::_static/image54| and Exit Design Mode
button |..image::_static/image55| at the top rightmost corner. When the Enter Design Mode
is clicked, you will be able to view the Advanced Editor at the left and
when the Exit Design Mode is clicked, you will be able to view the
Navigation panel at the left.

The right canvas also represents the Value Driver Tree with Nodes where
the simulation can be done at the Node Level (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/10.1.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    valQ Panel in Power BI

The left panel has five different Tab categories as Advanced Editor
options and they are listed below:

1. New Tab – To configure the design for the Value Driver Tree using the
   options such as Sample Demo Tree, Create a Simple Dynamic Tree,
   Import an Advanced Tree and Create a New value driver tree from the
   scratch.

2. Node Tab – To configure the settings of Nodes and Child Nodes for the
   Value Driver Tree

3. Data Series Tab – To configure the data settings such as Value Labels, Time
   Period Labels, Time Aggregation Labels, Periods of Interest, Node
   Mapping and Data Manager for the Value Driver Tree.

4. Appearance Tab – To configure the appearance parameters such as
   General Settings, Status Bar, Visualization and Colors for the Value
   Driver Tree

5. Settings Tab – To configure the Navigational Panel and Export
   settings for the Value Driver Tree.

In the next sections, you will be able to understand about these five
different Tab categories in detail.

Designing a Value Driver Tree in Power BI
=========================================

As an initial step, follow the below steps to configure the design for
the value driver tree in Power BI.

1. Navigate to the “Visualizations Panel” and “Fields” Panel in Power BI
   (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/11.1.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Power BI with Visualizations and Fields Panel

2. In the Visualizations Panel, select the valQ Custom Visual and extend
   the screen to its full view as shown in the Figure below.

.. figure:: _static/eleven.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    valQ Screen - Measures to be assigned

3. To create a value driver tree (valQ) in Power BI, it is mandatory to
   assign a Data Source to the value driver tree. For our example, a
   data source (sample data shown below) has been assigned to the value
   driver tree.

.. figure:: _static/11.2.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

General
~~~~~~~

In General settings you will be able to configure the Node details such
as Unique ID, Title and the Title Prefix when outside the Tree with the
values as shown in the below Figure. The Title Prefix can be set at Node
Level and during simulation it is useful to identify at which node the
parameter value changes. The additional properties of the Node Tab has
been listed in Section 13.2.

.. figure:: _static/12.8.png

screen as shown below.

.. figure:: _static/12.9.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    valQ screen with General settings

From the above Figure, you can observe that the Unique ID for the Parent
Node is “TOP” and the Title of the Parent Node is “Net Profit”.

In our other example as shown below, we have configured the Title Prefix
for two different Nodes (see Figures below).

.. figure:: _static/12.10.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Node with Prefix value as Spouse 1

.. figure:: _static/12.11.png

    valQ screen with Spouse 2 Prefix

From the above two Figures you can observe that the “Gross Salary” is
the common Title for two different Nodes. In order to differentiate
them, we have provided the value for “Title Prefix when outside the
Tree” as Spouse1 for one Node and Spouse 2 for the other Node. After
simulation, you can see which Node’s value has been changed.

Configuration 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Configuration Settings, you will be able to configure the Node
details such as Calculation Method, Time Aggregation, Desired Trend and
Value Range with the values as shown in the below Figure.

.. figure:: _static/12.14.png

    valQ with Configuration settings

From the above Figure you can observe that in the Navigation Panel, the
value that is displayed in the Constraints section will lie in the range
from minimum 10 to maximum 100 for a specific month based on the
configuration done for the Value Range. In our example, the calculation
method is selected as “Subtract Children (a-b-c)” meaning that the child
node having greater value will get subtracted from the child node having
smaller value and its result will be displayed in the Parent Node. The
Time Aggregation is set to Sum of Periods where we have considered 12
months as period. As the result of simulation, each Node will display
the values based on the Sum of Periods. Also the “Desired Trend” has
been set to the Increase option. When simulated, the desired Trend for
the Revenue will be increasing and the value for the Total Cost will be
decreasing.

Display 
~~~~~~~~

In the Display Settings, you will be able to configure the Node Display
settings such as Node Display, Scale, Value Decimal Places, Value
Prefix, Value Suffix, Simulation, Status Colors and Details with the
values as shown in the below Figure.

.. figure:: _static/12.16.png
    :align: center

    valQ with Display settings

From the above Figure, you can observe that the Node Display is set to
“Show” option. The Scale has been set to the User Selected option and
now you can edit the Scaling options in the Value Display under Settings
Tab. When the Scale is set to other options you will not be able to edit
the Scaling options in the Value Display. You can also view the Nodes
with the values configured with Value Decimal Places as “0”, Value
Prefix as “$” and Value Suffix as “r”. The Simulation option has been
enabled which allows the real time change to Nodes value and its effect
on others. The Status Colors option has been enabled which shows the
colored status bar indicating positive or negative trend.

Since the Details on Click option is enabled in the Display settings,
you can observe the Detail Page being displayed after clicking the Node
“Net Profit” (see Figure below). If the Details on Click option is
disabled in the Display settings, then you will not be able to view the

*Additional Properties of New Tab*

Node Tab
========

Each node represents a metric, and can contain the following:

-  Name of the value driver or KPI

-  A sparkline graph indicating the recent trend

-  The value of the metric in bold letters

.. figure:: _static/13.1.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Node Details

In addition, each node also contains several performance metrics (see
Figure below). They are listed as follows:

-  The Fiscal Year variance of the metric vs. a benchmark (in this case,
   Sales Forecast vs. Sales Budget) – this is shown in both % and
   absolute terms

-  Absolute value of the metric for the current month (usually the first
   period in the series)

-  Variance of the metric vs. a benchmark for the current month – this
   is shown in both % and absolute terms.

A node may be decorated by a performance indicator color band on the
left – typically Green (for good), Amber (neither good nor bad) and Red
(Poor).

.. figure:: _static/13.2.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Node Details

The entire configuration part of the Node Tab has been already explained
in detail in :ref:`Section: Open a Sample Model <OSM>`.

Templated Nodes
---------------

Also you can create a Templated Node for the already existing Node. It
is very specific that the Templated Nodes should not map the Parent
Node. You need to select the particular Node and copy a Node under the
selected Node for creating the Templated Node.

In the below Figure as an example, you can observe that a copy of
Revenue Node has been created by the right click copy and paste actions.
Now the copied Revenue Node version is labelled as “Revenue 2” in
General Property of the Edit Node Window (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/13.3.png
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Edit Node: Copy of Revenue Node labelled as Revenue 2

Now navigate to the Configuration property of the Edit Node Window. Set

Year” is being compared with the simulated secondary values for Active
Period, Total to Period, Total of Period and the Selected Interval.

Node Mapping
------------

This setting captures how data from Power BI Queries is mapped to the
Nodes in the Tree. These settings are enabled only if your Queries are
mapped to this Custom Visual.

In the Node Mapping settings in valQ, there are 3 options available as
listed below:

1. Automatic mapping based on whole field value - For example, you can
   use this option if the field value exactly matches your Node’s unique
   ID (e.g., ‘Canada’)

2. Automatic mapping based on a key-text paired field value - For
   example, you can use this option if your field has a key-text format
   (e.g., ‘CA:Canada’), and your Node’s ID corresponds to a key (e.g.,
   ‘CA’).

3. Manual Mapping – Using this option, you can map each Node manually.

For our example, we would explore the settings for Automatic mapping
based on a key-text paired field value. The data source which is
assigned for the Node Mapping is shown below:

Manual Data configured in the Nodes”.

Data Manager
------------

Using the Data Manager settings, you will be able to view and customize
your Data Source. You will be able to select the Sort fields, sort the
data with Ascending or Descending Order and select the Start With field
with the required Month (see Figure below).

In General settings you have the ability to configure the Top Node,
setting the display of number of children Nodes for the Top Node, set
the zoom ratio for the Node, set the Auto scale for the data format to
be displayed in the Tree Widget and configure the scale suffix for the
units Thousands, Millions and Billions at the Node level. You will be
able to configure the Number Format Settings namely Display as Zero,
Display Negative Value as, Decimal Separator and Thousand Separator and
provide the Hint information at the top of the canvas (see Figure
below).

Hide Empty Nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For our example, activate the property Enable Hide Empty Nodes in the Appearance Tab (see Figure below).

.. figure:: _static/en2.png 
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Hide Empty Nodes 

The below condition will be applied when the property Enable Hide Empty Nodes is enabled.

When one of the child node has null value, then the specific child node will be hidden. 
Also when the Writeback Functionality is enabled, then the child node with null values will not undergo the writeback functionality.

Horizontal Waterfall Chart Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the Detail page will be displayed with the Vertical Chart
type. You can also select the “Horizontal” Waterfall Chart Type by
navigating to the appearance Tab as shown in the below Figure.

Status Bar
----------

In Status Bar settings, you have the ability to define the status bar
for the Node and also define the meaning for the statuses. Each Node
will display the status bar when there is a change in Variance,
Simulation Impact and Hidden conditions (see Figure below). The status
bar color changes based on the percentage of deviant from the initial
value.

.. figure:: _static/15.5.png
    :align: center

    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text

    Nodes with different status bars

From the above Figure, you will be able to observe that the Nodes “Net
Profit” and “Total Cost” has red status bar since the variance values
for both the Nodes are below -10%. The Node “Revenue” has the green
status bar since the variance value for this Node is above 1%.

Visualization
-------------

In the Visualization settings, you will be able to configure the Node
Style with three different options namely Standard, Full and Minimal.
Also you will be able to enable/disable the contents like Variance,
Trend Spark Line, Secondary Value/Variance and Node Operand in the Node. You can  
set the Default Visual as Table or Tree option. For our example, the Default Visual 
has been selected as Tree (see Figure below).
