Analyze Category
================

Using the Analyze Category, you will be able to perform the Variance Analysis for the Base Series versus 
Compared Series. By clicking the Analyze Tab, you will be able to view the Variance Analysis option 
(see Figure below).

    Analyze Category 

By clicking the Variance Analysis option, you will be able to view the Variance Analysis screen (see Figure below). 
Now you can  perform the Variance Analysis for the Base Series versus Compared Series by selecting the required 
Period and Filters. For our example, both the Base and Compared Series will have the Budget and Forecast values. 
Also they can have additional series values based on the Data Source that you assign and those values 
can be considered for the Base Series versus Compared Series. For our example, Base Series has been selected as 
“Budget” and the Compared Series has been selected as “Forecast”

    Variance Analysis with Base Series versus Compared Series

The Period selection includes the following options:

1.	Weekly
2.	Monthly
3.	Quarter-to- date
4.	Quarter
5.	Half Year
6.	Half Year-to-date
7.	Year-to date
8.	Year-to-go
9.	Full Year
 
The details for the individual Period Selection has been explained below:

Weekly
------

When the Period is selected as “Weekly”, then the Variance Analysis for the  Base Series versus 
Compared Series will be based on the week selection that falls within a year which is from 1st to 52nd week.

Monthly
-------

When the Period is selected as “Monthly”, then the Variance Analysis for the  Base Series versus 
Compared Series will be based on the month selection that falls within a year which is from Jan to Dec.

Quarter-to-date
---------------

When the Period is selected as “Quarter-to-date”, then the Variance Analysis for the
Base Series versus Compared Series will be based on the Quarter-to-date selection that 
falls within a Quarter in Year. For example, if the Base Period is selected as “Feb”, then the 
Variance Analysis will be performed for Jan and Feb months alone (see Figure below).

    Period selected as Quarter-to-date

Quarter
-------

When the Period is selected as “Quarter”, then the Variance Analysis for the Base Series versus Compared Series 
will be based on the Quarter selection that falls within a year which is from Jan to Mar, Apr to Jun, 
Jul to Sep and Oct to Dec. For example, if the Base Period is selected as “Feb”, then the 
Variance Analysis will be performed for the first Quarter from Jan to Mar month (see Figure below).

    Period selected as Quarter

Half Year
---------

When the Period is selected as “Half Year”, then the Variance Analysis for the  Base Series versus 
Compared Series will be based on the Half Year selection that falls within a year which is from Jan to Jun 
and Jul to Dec. For example, if the Base Period is selected as “Feb”, then the 
Variance Analysis will be performed for the first Half Year which is from Jan to Jun month (see Figure below).

    Period selected as Half Year

Half Year-to-date
-----------------

When the Period is selected as “Half Year-to-date”, then the Variance Analysis for the  Base Series versus 
Compared Series will be based on the Half Year-to-date selection that falls within a Half Year. 
For example, if the Base Period is selected as “Apr”, then the Variance Analysis will be 
performed from Jan to Apr month which falls in the First Half Year period (see Figure below).

    Period selected as Half Year-to-date

Year-to-date
------------

When the Period is selected as “Year-to-date”, then the Variance Analysis for the  Base Series versus 
Compared Series will be based on the Year-to-date selection that falls within a Year. For example, if the 
Base Period is selected as “Oct”, then the Variance Analysis will be performed from Jan to Oct month 
which falls in a Year period (see Figure below).

    Period selected as Year-to-date

Year-to-go
----------

When the Period is selected as “Year-to-go”, then the Variance Analysis for the  Base Series versus 
Compared Series will be based on the Year-to-go selection that falls within a Year. For example, if the 
Base Period is selected as “Feb”, then the Variance Analysis will be performed from Mar to Dec month 
leaving the rest of the months from Jan to Feb (see Figure below).

    Period selected as Year-to-go

Full Year
---------

When the Period is selected as “Full Year”, then the Variance Analysis for the  Base Series versus 
Compared Series will be based on the Full Year selection that falls within a year which is from Jan to Dec. 
For example, if the Base Period is selected as “Jul”, then the Variance Analysis will be performed for the 
Full Year which is from Jan to Dec month (see Figure below).

    Period selected as Full Year

The Variance Analysis for the  Base Series versus Compared Series can be also performed based on comparing the 
same Base Period or comparing to different Base Period (see Figure below). The above mentioned Period 
selections have been explained  based on the Base Period being selected as “Compare same period”.

    Budget vs Forecast for the same Base Period

As an example, the below Figure shows the Variance Analysis that was performed based on comparing the 
different Base Period.

    Budget vs Forecast for the different Base Period

It is to be noted that the Base Series selection and the Compared Series selection should not have the  
similar option for the same Base Period. As an example, Budget selected as Base Series cannot be compared with 
Budget selected as Compared Series for any Base Period. 

The Periods can be also selected collectively and the Variance Analysis for the selected combination
will be displayed as shown in the below Figure. In our example, the Period has been collectively selected 
as Monthly and Half Year.

    Period selected as Monthly and Half Year

From the above Figure, you can observe that the Variance Analysis has been performed for the periods 
“Monthly” and “Half Year”. Also the Base Period for Budget is selected as “Jan” and the Base Period for 
the Forecast is selected as “Mar”. 
 
The Filter option has the ability to filter the records based on the Variance values. It shows the 
Top number of Variance values for the selected Period (see Figure below).
